# CS292C Computer-Aided Reasoning for Software

This course is a comprehensive introduction to solvere-aided reasoning for software with a special focus on program synthesis: an emerging area that sits at the intersection of systems, programming languages, HCI, and artificial intelligence. The goal of program synthesis is to generate programs automatically from high-level, potentially informal and incomplete descriptions. The course covers recent advances in synthesis techniques that differ in the kind of specifications (from input-output examples to formal correctness specifications), search strategies (enumerative, stochastic, or symbolic search), and information to guide the search (counter-example guided synthesis, type-driven synthesis, synthesis with machine learning). The course involves a project, 3 programming assignments, and reviewing research papers.
